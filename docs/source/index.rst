Welcome to Uniswap V4 Hook Fuzzer's documentation!
==================================================

The goal of our project is to create a framework to make it easier
for UniswapV4 hook developers to test their hooks using stateful fuzz
tests.

The framework builds upon the fuzz testing capabilities of `Woke <https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/woke>`_,  a
Python package for testing Solidity smart contracts.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
